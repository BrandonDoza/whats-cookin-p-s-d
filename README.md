# What's Cookin'? Starter Kit

The details of this project are outlined in the <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/What%27sCookin-PartOne.html" target="\__blank">project spec</a>.

## Set Up:
After cloning repository to your machine using SSH `git clone git@github.com:BrandonDoza/whats-cookin-p-s-d.git`
Install or change to `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` then:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Do not run `npm audit fix --force`, as this will update to an imcopatible version of web-pack.

## On Running Tests:
The testing libraries will already be installed by the set up, however; you will want to go into recipes and comment the empty arrays and uncomments the commented functions and import statements at the top. These data imports and get functions were replaced by references to an api call done outside recipes in the final version.
