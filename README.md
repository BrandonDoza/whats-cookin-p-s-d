## Context:
The basis of this project was to build a web application that allows users to search, view, and save recipes to cook. Based on the users experience, the user can add recipes to their favorites on a click and remove them on a double click. This project was a a two week project that was space out 2 weeks apart 2 months into our coding journey at Turing. Total project time was approximately 40 hours.

## Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project was for us as learning Developers to utilize testing in the building and planning of the web application while integrating the use of APIs with GET and POST request. This project was to  solidify our understanding of integrating `SCSS`, `Javascript`, and `HTML`, and how to simultaneously manage input on the DOM and data model. The technology we use in this learning experience was `Mocha`, `Chai`, and `Webpack`.

## Wins + Challenges:
- Win 1: Really leaning into the knowledge we have gained throughout out time at Turing to complete this project.
- Win 2: Learning a lot about our fellow teammates, everyones individual ideas, and how to come together to accomplish our goal.  
- Win 3: Our time management was laid out very well from the beginning, and allowed us extra time in the end to fix bugs and refactor our code. 
- Challenges: Minor breakdowns in communication that led to small interruptions in work flow. Adhering to our assigned tasks and letting each person contribute evenly.

## Part 2 questions:
- How was the new feature handled?
  - We discussed several approaches as a group and after deciding on one created an issue with its component tasks and divided them amongst the group. The feature was displaying and converting currencies on the recipe page.
- What was done to address accessibility?
  - To address accessibility we used a number of automated auditing tools like WAVE and Lighthouse, as well as notes made during our usability tests.
- How usability testing was implemented?
  - We received feedback on clarity of how to do certain things like delete recipes and accessibility, both of which were easy enough fixed that we just took care of them quickly on a branch labeled with addressing those comments.
